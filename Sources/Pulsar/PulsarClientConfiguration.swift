	/// Creates a new Pulsar Client configuration.
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - host: The host to connect to. Doesn't need the `pulsar://` prefix.
	///   - port: The port to connect to. Normally `6650`.
	///   - tlsConfiguration: If you connect to a `pulsar+ssl` URL, you need to provide a TLS configuration.
	///   - group: If you want to pass your own EventLoopGroup, you can do it here. Otherwise the client will create it's own.
	///   - reconnectionLimit: How often the client should try reconnecting, if a connection is lost. The reconnection happens with an exponential backoff. The default limit is 10. Pass `nil` if the client should try reconnecting indefinitely.
